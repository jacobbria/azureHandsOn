This project seeks to gets experience creating vnets, subnets, and understand how we can create communication between them and the outside world. 

## Networks

| **Component**     | **Description**                | **NSG**        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Org VNet          | Private network                | —              |
| Default Subnet    | Holds VM1                      | LNX-VM-1-nsg     |
| VNet2             | Holds VM2                      | LNX-VM-2-nsg     |


By default these two subnets should be able to communicate
